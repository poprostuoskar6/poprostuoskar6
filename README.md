## 💭 Development Philosophy

Over time, I've developed certain principles that guide how I approach software development. These aren't rigid rules but guiding philosophies that help me make better decisions.

**Code is Communication:** Code is read far more often than it's written. I prioritize clarity and expressiveness over cleverness. Well-named variables, clear function purposes, and thoughtful architecture make code maintainable and enjoyable to work with.

**User-Centered Design:** Technology serves people. Every technical decision should ultimately trace back to creating value for users. Performance optimizations, feature implementations, and design choices all matter because they impact the people using what we build.

**Continuous Improvement:** There's always a better way. I approach every project as a learning opportunity. Whether it's a new pattern, a better testing strategy, or a more elegant solution, I'm always looking to refine my craft.

**Pragmatic Technology Choices:** The best tool is the one that solves the problem effectively. I avoid both technology dogmatism and chasing trends. Instead, I evaluate technologies based on the specific requirements, team expertise, and long-term maintainability.

**Test-Driven Thinking:** Even when not doing strict TDD, I think about testability. Code that's easy to test is usually well-designed code. Good tests serve as documentation and provide confidence when refactoring.
